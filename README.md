# Financial-Sentimental-Analysis

Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In the financial domain, sentiment analysis can be used to gauge market sentiment from news articles, tweets, and other textual data sources.

This project uses an RNN to perform sentiment analysis on financial texts.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project should be a collection of financial news articles or tweets labeled with sentiment. The preprocessing steps handle missing values and prepare the text for model training.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
pandas
You can install the required packages using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow scikit-learn pandas
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/financial_sentiment_analysis_rnn.git
cd financial_sentiment_analysis_rnn
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset and place it in the project directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Financial_sentiment_analysis_RNN.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

Model Training
The notebook includes steps to:

Load and preprocess the data.
Tokenize and pad the text sequences.
Define and compile the RNN model.
Train the model on the dataset.
Evaluation
After training the model, the notebook provides methods to evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
Results of the model training and evaluation are displayed in the notebook. Example outputs, model performance metrics, and visualizations will help in understanding the effectiveness of the model.
